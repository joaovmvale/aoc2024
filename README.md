# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions

Welcome to my repository for **Advent of Code 2024**! This repo is where I'll be documenting and sharing my solutions to the daily coding challenges from the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

## What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code (AoC) is an annual event featuring a series of daily programming puzzles that run from December 1st to December 25th. It's a fun way to sharpen your programming skills, learn new techniques, and challenge yourself with progressively tougher problems. Each day offers two parts to solve, and completing one part unlocks the next.

## Repository Structure

- Each day will have its own directory named `dayXX`, where `XX` is the day number (e.g., `day01`, `day02`, etc.).
- Inside each directory, you'll typically find:
  - **`input.txt`**: The puzzle input for that day.
  - **`solution.go`**: My solution in the programming language of choice (e.g., Golang, Python, etc.).

## Languages and Tools

I'll be using the following tools and languages for this year's AoC challenges:

- Primary Language: Golang
- IDE/Editor: VSCode (With Plugins)
- Version Control: Git (this repository!)

## How to Run the Solutions

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/joaovmvale/aoc2024.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the specific day's directory:

   ```bash
   cd aoc2024/dayXX
   ```

3. Run the solution file using the appropriate command for the programming language. For example, if the solution is in Python:

   ```bash
   go run solution.go
   ```

## Contributions

This is a personal repository for learning and growth, so contributions aren't expected. However, feel free to open an issue if you spot bugs or want to discuss a solution.
